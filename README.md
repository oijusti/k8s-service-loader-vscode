# Kubernetes Port Forward Service

A Visual Studio Code extension that simplifies port forwarding for Kubernetes services with an interactive UI.

## Features

- List all available services across namespaces or in a specific namespace
- Select services and environments (dev, qa, stg) through an intuitive UI
- Automatic port detection for Kubernetes services
- Custom local and remote port configuration
- Real-time status updates with spinner animations
- Dedicated output channel for each port-forwarding session
- Option to view real-time logs for the selected service

## Requirements

- Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) installed and configured
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster
- Kubernetes services following the naming convention described below

## Service Naming Convention

This extension expects Kubernetes services to follow a specific naming pattern:

```
<environment>-<namespace>-<service-name>-<deployment-id>
```

Where:
- `<environment>`: The deployment environment (dev, qa, stg)
- `<namespace>`: The Kubernetes namespace
- `<service-name>`: The actual service name
- `<deployment-id>`: The deployment identifier (typically auto-generated by Kubernetes)

Example:
```
dev-identity-services-auth-claim-store-66ff887974-hg8td
```

In this example:
- Environment: `dev`
- Namespace: `identity-services`
- Service name: `auth-claim-store`
- Deployment ID: `66ff887974-hg8td`

The extension will extract the service name from this pattern and group services by name across environments.

## Usage

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Kubernetes: Port-Forward Service" and select the command
3. Optionally enter a namespace or leave empty to search across all namespaces
4. Select a service from the list
5. Choose an environment (dev, qa, stg)
6. Enter a local port (default: 3000)
7. Confirm or modify the detected destination port
8. The extension will start port forwarding in a dedicated terminal
9. Choose whether to view real-time logs for the service (Yes/No)
10. If you select "Yes", logs will appear in a separate terminal window
